** 1. Each node is either red or black.
** 2. The root is black. This rule is sometimes omitted.
** Since the root can always be changed from red to black, but not necessarily
** vice versa, this rule has little effect on analysis.
** 3. All leaves (NIL) are black.
** 4. If a node is red, then both its children are black.
** 5. Every path from a given node to any of its descendant NIL nodes contains
** the same number of black nodes. Some definitions: the number of black nodes
** from the root to a node is the node's black depth; the uniform number of
** black nodes in all paths from root to the leaves is called the black-height
** of the redâ€“black tree.
